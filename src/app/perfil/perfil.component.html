                   Hello! My name is Brittany and I enjoy creating things that live on the internet. 
                   My interest in web development started back in 2012 when I decided to try editing custom Tumblr themes — 
                   turns out hacking together a custom reblog button taught me a lot about HTML & CSS!

                    Fast-forward to today, and I’ve had the privilege of working at an advertising agency, a start-up, a huge corporation, 
                    and a student-led design studio. My main focus these days is building accessible,
                    inclusive products and digital experiences at Upstatement for a variety of clients. 
                </p>

                    I also recently launched a course that covers everything you need to build a web app with the Spotify API using Node & React.

                    Here are a few technologies I’ve been working with recently:
